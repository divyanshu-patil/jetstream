On the settings page, you can perform the following actions:

- **Don't Auto-Login on Link Clicks**: When enabled, Jetstream will not automatically log you in to Salesforce when you click on a link in an email.
  - Use this if you have SSO configured and clicking Salesforce links from Jetstream asks you to login again.
  - When this setting is enabled, clicking Salesforce links will be much faster as long as you are already logged in to Salesforce.
- **Logging**: Enable or disable logging of your Jetstream activity within your browser's console.
  - Use this if you are experiencing issues with Jetstream and need to provide logs to the Jetstream team.
- **Delete Account**: Delete your Jetstream account. This action is irreversible.
